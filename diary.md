# Diary

This is what I've done every time I've worked on this.

## 10.3.2023

- Started with the thesis project.
- Tested that lights and OpenDMX work.
- Started the work on git.
- Started using Pyusb, and how I could do this.
- Found couple of direct USB to DMX gits, but I don't want to use them. I want to learn them by myself.
- Foundout what the VendorID and ProductID is for OpenDMX (find_usb dir).
- Did Readme and TODO list.
- Used couple of tutorials to get it working: [Pyusb tutorial](https://github.com/pyusb/pyusb/blob/master/docs/tutorial.rst)..
- OpenDMX doesn't have drivers, so have to install Zadig to install WinUSB [How to use Libusb on Windows](https://github.com/libusb/libusb/wiki/Windows#How_to_use_libusb_on_Windows).
  - libusb is the backend for pyusb.
